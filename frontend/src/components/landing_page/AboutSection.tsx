            MemeLend was born from frustration — watching creators dump, traders get rugged, and communities fade overnight. 
            <br />
            So we built something different. A platform where every launch is transparent, every outcome is tradeable, 
            and everyone plays by the same rules. 
            <br />
            Here, success and failure both have value — and fairness isn’t optional.
